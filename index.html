        <h4>Topological Sorting Algorithm</h4>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">A Topological sort or Topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering 
            of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u 
            comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent 
            tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be 
            performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid 
            sequence for the tasks.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here is the reference to the Algorithm:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting</a></p>
        <pre> 
Below is the code of the above approach:  

            int n; // number of vertices
            vector<vector<int>> adj; // adjacency list of graph
            vector<bool> visited;
            vector<int> ans;
            
            void dfs(int v) {
                visited[v] = true;
                for (int u : adj[v]) {
                    if (!visited[u])
                        dfs(u);
                }
                ans.push_back(v);
            }
            
            void topological_sort() {
                visited.assign(n, false);
                ans.clear();
                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                    if (!visited[i])
                        dfs(i);
                }
                reverse(ans.begin(), ans.end());
            }
